# Ninja-ID-ReactNative
I wrote an exact same app as before to compare with the one uses Flutter.

## About
This is a dead simple app I wrote just to compare the following points between React Native vs. [this Flutter app](https://github.com/QuangTran304/Ninja-ID)
- Code / language structure
- Syntax
- Separation of concerns
- Ease of implementation
