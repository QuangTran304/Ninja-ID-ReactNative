# Ninja-ID-ReactNative
I wrote an exact same app as before to compare with the one uses Flutter. The app has 1 clickable button at bottom right to increase the "Ninja level".

## About
This is a dead simple app I wrote just to compare the following points between React Native vs. [this Flutter app](https://github.com/QuangTran304/Ninja-ID)
- Code / language structure
- Syntax
- Separation of concerns
- Ease of implementation

## App Screenshot

## Instructions
- Main app entry point is `App.js`
- Run `yarn install` to download all dependencies
- Run `expo start` ==> select `run on iOS / Android simulator` from the popup browser window
